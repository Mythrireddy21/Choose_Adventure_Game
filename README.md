## How to Play

1. The story text appears on the screen.
2. Choose from the available options by clicking buttons.
3. Your choice leads you to a new story scene.
4. Explore different choices to unlock all story endings!

## How to Extend the Story

The story data is stored in the `story` dictionary inside `app.py`.

* Each key is a scene ID.
* Each scene contains:

  * `text`: narrative description
  * `choices`: dictionary of choice text â†’ next scene ID

To add new scenes, just add new entries like this:

```python
"new_scene": {
    "text": "You find a mysterious door. What do you do?",
    "choices": {
        "Open the door": "treasure_room",
        "Walk away": "forest"
    }
}
```

## Dependencies

* Python 3.7 or higher
* Flask (installed via `requirements.txt`)


## Customization

* Change the CSS in `static/style.css` to update the look and feel.
* Modify `index.html` to adjust frontend layout and design.
* Add more scenes and choices in `app.py` to expand the story.
